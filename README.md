## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note About the Code
This repository contains the **basic structure** of the KCET Notes app. To protect sensitive information, certain methods, endpoints, and unique features (like custom implementations) have been replaced with **placeholders**. As a result, running this code directly in an IDE like Android Studio **will not work** without proper configuration. I‚Äôd be thrilled to demonstrate the full functionality and unique features during an interview!
